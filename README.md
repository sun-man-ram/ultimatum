## 📘 Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a **quantum-resistant communication protocol for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV)**.  
The goal is to analyze existing cryptographic mechanisms (Elliptic Curve, RSA, Diffie–Hellman, ElGamal, etc.),  
review post-quantum algorithms, and propose a **secure IoV framework** resilient against quantum computing attacks.
